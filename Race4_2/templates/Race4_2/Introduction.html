In each round, you are asked to play one of six variations of the following game against a computer player who is programmed to make every choice to maximize the chance of winning. </font></p><font size="4pt" style="line-height: 200%">The two players, you and the computer, alternate: you move first, the computer moves next, you move again, and so on. You always move first from 0, and in each turn one can add an integer number between 1 and K. (For instance, if K = 3, one can add 1, 2 or 3). The player who gets to M first wins the game (for example, M can be 10). If you win a game, you receive 5 tokens. Otherwise, you receive 0 tokens. </font></div>    {% next_button %}{% endblock %}
